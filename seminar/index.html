<h4 id="a-namealtschulera-jason-altschuler-privacy-of-noisy-sgd"><a name='altschuler'></a> Jason Altschuler: Privacy of Noisy SGD</h4>
<p>A central issue in machine learning is how to train models on sensitive user data. Industry has widely adopted a simple algorithm: Stochastic Gradient Descent with noise (aka Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics). However, foundational theoretical questions about this algorithm’s privacy loss remain open—even in the seemingly simple setting of smooth convex losses over a bounded domain. Our main result resolves these questions: for a large range of parameters, we characterize the differential privacy up to a constant factor. This result reveals that all previous analyses for this setting have the wrong qualitative behavior. Specifically, while previous privacy analyses increase ad infinitum in the number of iterations, we show that after a small burn-in period, running SGD longer leaks no further privacy.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will describe this result and our analysis techniques—which depart completely from previous approaches based on fast mixing, instead using techniques based on optimal transport.</p>

<h4 id="a-nameleia-qi-lei-optimal-gradient-based-algorithms-for-non-concave-bandit-optimization"><a name='lei'></a> Qi Lei: Optimal Gradient-based Algorithms for Non-concave Bandit Optimization</h4>
<p>Bandit problems with linear or concave reward have been extensively studied, but relatively few works have studied bandits with non-concave reward. In this talk, we consider a large family of bandit problems where the unknown underlying reward function is non-concave, including the low-rank generalized linear bandit problems and two-layer neural network with polynomial activation bandit problem. For the low-rank generalized linear bandit problem, we provide a minimax-optimal algorithm in the dimension, refuting both conjectures in (Lu et al. 2021) and (Jun et al. 2019). Our algorithms are based on a unified zeroth-order optimization paradigm that applies in great generality and attains optimal rates in several structured polynomial settings (in the dimension). We further demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms in RL in the generative model setting, resulting in improved sample complexity over prior approaches. Finally, we show that the standard optimistic algorithms (e.g., UCB) are sub-optimal by dimension factors. In the neural net setting (with polynomial activation functions) with noiseless reward, we provide a bandit algorithm with sample complexity equal to the intrinsic algebraic dimension. Again, we show that optimistic approaches have worse sample complexity, polynomial in the extrinsic dimension (which could be exponentially worse in the polynomial degree).</p>
<h4 id="a-namenatia-nati-srebro-learning-by-overfitting-a-statistical-learning-view-of-benign-overfitting"><a name='nati'></a> Nati Srebro: Learning by Overfitting: A Statistical Learning view of Benign Overfitting</h4>
<p>The classic view of statistical learning tells us that we should balance model fit with model complexity instead of insisting on training error that&rsquo;s much lower than what we can expect to generalize to, or even lower than the noise level or Bayes error.  And that this balance, and control on model complexity ensures good generalization.  But in recent years we have seen that in many situations we can learn and generalize without such a balance, and despite (over?) fitting the training set well below the noise level.  This has caused us to rethink the basic principles underlying statistical learning theory.  In this talk I will discuss how much of our theory we can salvage and how much of it needs to be revised, focusing on the role of uniform convergence in understanding interpolation learning.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Lijia Zhou, Fred Koehler, Danica Sutherland and Pragya Sur</p>
<h4 id="a-nameborisa-boris-hanin-exact-solutions-to-bayesian-interpolation-with-deep-linear-networks"><a name='boris'></a> Boris Hanin: Exact Solutions to Bayesian Interpolation with Deep Linear Networks</h4>
<p>This talk concerns Bayesian interpolation with an overparameterized linear neural networks (products of matrices) with quadratic log-likelihood and Gaussian prior on model parameters. I will present ongoing work, joint with Alexander Zlokapa (MIT Physics), in which we obtain an exact representation - in terms of special functions known as Meijer G-functions - for the posterior distribution of the predictor which holds for any fixed choice of input dimension, layer widths, depth, and number of training datapoints. Analyzing these expressions reveals that at finite depth, in the limit of infinite width and number of datapoints, networks are never Bayes optimal. However, in the triple scaling limit of large number of datapoint, width, and depththe posterior becomes independent of the prior and is the same as the Bayes optimal predictor at finite depth. In particular, at infinite depth, the prior does not need to be fine-tuned to achieve optimality, either in the Bayesian or the L_2-sense.</p>
<h4 id="a-namequentina-quentin-berthet-perturbed-optimizers-and-an-accelerated-frank-wolfe-algorithm"><a name='quentin'></a> Quentin Berthet: Perturbed optimizers and an Accelerated Frank-Wolfe Algorithm</h4>
<p>We propose a systematic method to transform optimizers into operations that are differentiable and never locally constant. This expands the scope of learning problems that can be solved in an end-to-end fashion. Our approach relies on stochastically perturbed optimizers, and can be used readily together with existing solvers. Their derivatives can be evaluated efficiently, and smoothness tuned via the chosen noise amplitude. We also show how this framework can be connected to a family of losses developed in structured prediction, and give theoretical guarantees for their use in learning tasks.</p>
<p>We show applications to the problem of minimizing the sum of two convex functions. In particular, we show that this algorithmic setup naturally leads to a variant of Frank-Wolfe achieving acceleration under parallelization. More precisely, when minimizing a smooth convex function on a bounded domain, we show that one can achieve an ε primal-dual gap (in expectation) in O(1/√ε) iterations, by only accessing gradients of the original function and a linear maximization oracle with O(1/√ε) computing units in parallel. We illustrate this fast convergence on synthetic numerical experiments.</p>
<h4 id="a-nameshipraa-shipra-agrawal-dynamic-pricing-and-learning-under-the-bass-model"><a name='shipra'></a> Shipra Agrawal: Dynamic Pricing and Learning under the Bass Model</h4>
<p>In this talk, I will discuss a novel formulation of the dynamic pricing and demand learning problem, where the evolution of demand in response to posted prices is governed by a stochastic variant of the popular Bass model with parameters (α, β) that are linked to the so-called &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and &ldquo;imitation&rdquo; effects. Unlike the more commonly used i.i.d. demand models, in this model the price posted not only affects the demand and the revenue in the current round but also the evolution of demand, and hence the fraction of market potential that can be captured, in future rounds. Finding a revenue-maximizing dynamic pricing policy in this model is non-trivial even when model parameters are known, and requires solving for the optimal non-stationary policy of a continuous-time, continuous-state MDP. In this work, we consider the problem of dynamic pricing in conjunction with learning the model parameters, with the objective of optimizing the cumulative revenues over a given selling horizon. Our main contribution is an algorithm with a regret guarantee of O (m^2/3), where m is the mnemonic for the (known) market size. Moreover, we show that no algorithm can incur smaller order of loss by deriving a matching lower bound. We observe that in this problem the market size m, and not the time horizon T, is the fundamental driver of the complexity; our lower bound in fact indicates that for any fixed α,β, most non-trivial instances of the problem have constant T and large m. This insight sets the problem setting considered here uniquely apart from the MAB-type formulations typically considered in the learning-to-price literature.</p>

<h4 id="a-namexina-jack-xin-deepparticle-learning-multiscale-pdes-by-minimizing-wasserstein-distance-on-data-generated-from-interacting-particle-methods"><a name='xin'></a> Jack Xin: DeepParticle: learning multiscale PDEs by minimizing Wasserstein distance on data generated from interacting particle methods</h4>
<p>Multiscale time dependent partial differential equations (PDE) are challenging to compute by traditional mesh based methods especially when their solutions develop large gradients or concentrations at unknown locations. Particle methods, based on microscopic aspects of the PDEs, are mesh free and self-adaptive, yet still expensive when a 
long time or a resolved computation is necessary.</p>
<p>We present DeepParticle, an integrated deep learning, optimal transport (OT), and interacting particle (IP) approach, to speed up 
generation and prediction of PDE dynamics of interest through two case studies. 
One is on large time front speeds of Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equation (FKPP) modeling flames in fluid flows with chaotic streamlines; the other is 
on a Keller-Segel (KS) chemotaxis system modeling bacteria evolution in fluid flows 
in the presence of a chemical attractant.</p>
<p>Analysis of FKPP reduces the problem to a computation of principal eigenvalue of 
an advection-diffusion operator. A normalized Feynman-Kac representation 
makes possible a genetic IP algorithm that 
evolves the initial uniform particle distribution to a large time invariant measure 
from which to extract the front speeds. The invariant measure is parameterized 
by a physical parameter (the Peclet number). We train a 
light weight deep neural network with local and global skip connections to learn this family of invariant measures. The training data come from affordable IP computation in three dimensions at a few sample Peclet numbers. The training objective being minimized 
is a discrete Wasserstein distance in OT theory. The trained network predicts a more concentrated invariant measure at a larger Peclet number 
and also serves as a warm start to accelerate IP computation.</p>
<p>The KS is formulated as a McKean-Vlasov equation (macroscopic limit) of 
a stochastic IP system. The DeepParticle framework extends and 
learns to generate finite time bacterial aggregation patterns 
in three dimensional laminar and chaotic flows.</p>
