<h4 id="a-name-yoram-a-yoram-singer-adaptive-regularization"><a name="yoram"></a> Yoram Singer: Adaptive Regularization</h4>

<p>We describe a framework for deriving and analyzing online optimization algorithms that incorporate adaptive, data dependent regularization, also termed preconditioning. Such algorithms have been proven useful in stochastic optimization by reshaping the gradients according to the geometry of the data. Our framework captures and unifies much of the existing literature on adaptive online methods, including the AdaGrad and Online Newton Step algorithms as well as their diagonal versions. As a result, we obtain new convergence proofs for these algorithms that are substantially simpler than previous analyses. Our framework also exposes the rationale for the different preconditioned updates used in common stochastic optimization methods.</p>

<p>Joint work with Tomer Koren and Vineet Gupta (Google)</p>

<h4 id="a-name-esteban-a-esteban-tabak-conditional-density-estimation-through-optimal-transport"><a name="esteban"></a> Esteban Tabak: Conditional Density Estimation through Optimal Transport</h4>

<p>Conditional probability estimation and simulation provides data-based answers to all kinds of critical questions, such as the response of specific patients to different medical treatments, the effect of political measures on the economy, and weather and climate forecasts. In the complex systems behind these examples, the outcome of a process depends on many and diverse factors and is probabilistic in nature, due in part to our ignorance of other relevant factors and to the chaotic nature of the underlying dynamics.</p>

<p>This talk will describe a general procedure for the estimation and simulation of conditional probabilities based on two complementary ideas: the removal of the effect of covariates through a data-based, generalized version of the optimal transport barycenter problem, and the reduction of complexity through a low-rank tensor factorization/separation of variables procedure extended to variables of any type.</p>

<h4 id="a-name-laurent-a-laurent-demanet-extrapolation-from-sparsity"><a name="laurent"></a> Laurent Demanet: Extrapolation from sparsity</h4>

<p>This talk considers the basic question of frequency extrapolation of sparse signals observed over some frequency band, such as scattered bandlimited waves. How far, and how stably can we extend? I will review recent progress on the mathematical aspects of this question, which are tied to the notion of super-resolution. I will also discuss the robust “phase tracking” algorithmic approach, which is suitable for imaging modalities where the bandlimiting model is far from accurately known. Joint work with Nam Nguyen and Yunyue Elita Li.</p>

<h4 id="a-name-dustin-a-dustin-mixon-a-semidefinite-relaxation-of-k-means-clustering"><a name="dustin"></a> Dustin Mixon: A semidefinite relaxation of k-means clustering</h4>

<p>Recently, Awasthi et al proved that a semidefinite relaxation of the
k-means clustering problem is tight under a particular data model
called the stochastic ball model. This result exhibits two
shortcomings: (1) naive solvers of the semidefinite program are
computationally slow, and (2) the stochastic ball model prevents
outliers that occur, for example, in the Gaussian mixture model. This
talk will cover recent work that tackles each of these shortcomings.
First, I will discuss a new type of algorithm (introduced by Bandeira)
that combines fast non-convex solvers with the optimality certificates
provided by convex relaxations. Second, I will discuss how to analyze
the semidefinite relaxation under the Gaussian mixture model. In this
case, outliers in the data obstruct tightness in the relaxation, and
so fundamentally different techniques are required. Several open
problems will be posed throughout.</p>

<h4 id="a-name-lorenzo-a-lorenzo-rosasco-un-conventional-regularization-for-efficient-large-scale-machine-learning"><a name="lorenzo"></a> Lorenzo Rosasco: (Un)conventional regularization for efficient large scale machine learning</h4>

<p>Regularization is classically designed by  penalizing or imposing explicit constraints to an empirical objective function. This approach can be derived from different perspectives and has optimal statistical guarantees. However, it  postpones  computational  considerations to a separate analysis. In large scale scenarios, considering independently statistical and numerical  aspects often leads to prohibitive computational requirements.  It is then natural  to ask whether  different regularization principles exist or can be derived to encompass both aspects at once.
In this talk, we  will present several ideas in this direction, showing how procedures typically  developed to perform efficient computations  can  often be seen as a form implicit regularization. We will discuss how iterative optimization of an empirical objective  leads to regularization, and analyze the effect of acceleration, preconditioning and stochastic approximations. We will further discuss the regularization effect of sketching/subsampling methods by drawing a connection to classical regularization projection methods common in inverse problems.
We will show how  these form of  implicit regularization  can obtain  optimal statistical guarantees, with  dramatically reduced computational properties.
Joint work will Alessandro Rudi, Silvia Villa, Junhong Lin, Luigi Carratino.</p>

<h4 id="a-name-bach-a-francis-bach-bridging-the-gap-between-constant-step-size-stochastic-gradient-descent-and-markov-chains"><a name="bach"></a> Francis Bach: Bridging the Gap between Constant Step Size Stochastic Gradient Descent and Markov Chains</h4>

<p>We consider the minimization of an objective function given access to unbiased estimates of its gradient through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with constant step-size. While the detailed analysis was only performed for quadratic functions, we provide an explicit asymptotic expansion of the moments of the averaged SGD iterates that outlines the dependence on initial conditions, the effect of noise and the step-size, as well as the lack of convergence in the general (non-quadratic) case. For this analysis, we bring tools from Markov chain theory into the analysis of stochastic gradient and create new ones (similar but different from stochastic MCMC methods).  We then show that Richardson-Romberg extrapolation may be used to get closer to the global optimum and we show empirical improvements of the new extrapolation scheme. (joint work with Aymeric Dieuleveut and Alain Durmus).</p>
