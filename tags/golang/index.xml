      <description>The MaD group hosts semester-long thematic reading groups, which are publicly accessible here.
Current (Spring 2020) We are running a general group meeting on the broad theme of &amp;ldquo;Information Theory, Old and New.&amp;rdquo;
 Information and schedule are available here.   Previous Fall 2019 We ran a general group meeting on the broad theme of &amp;ldquo;statistical and computational tradeoffs in high-dimensional inference.&amp;rdquo;
 Information and schedule are available here.  Spring 2019 We organized three working groups on different topics:</description>

      <description>We are excited to announce the MaD+ (math and data plus) seminar, jointly organized between NYU and ETH. It is now a virtual seminar series, and depending on logistics and interest potentially evolve to a multi-location seminar once the world returns to normal (with talks hosted in one of the locations, and streamed). The topics will be in line with the physical MaD seminar hosted at the Center for Data Science and the Courant Institute (NYU).</description>
