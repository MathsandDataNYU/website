      <description>The Mad (Math and Data) group was created in fall 2016 by Afonso Bandeira, Joan Bruna and Carlos Fernandez-Granda, three Assistant Professors at the Courant Institute and the Center for Data Science.
We are always in the lookout for highly motivated students interested in understanding and developing the fundamental mathematical structures underpinning modern data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and their applications.</description>

      <description>The MaD group hosts semester-long thematic reading groups, which are publicly accessible here.
Current (Fall 2019) We are running a general group meeting, on the broad theme of &amp;ldquo;statistical and computational tradeoffs in high-dimensional inference.&amp;rdquo;
 Information and our schedule are available here.  Previous Spring 2019 We organized three working groups on different topics:
 The low-degree polynomials method; notes available here Nonconvex optimization Optimal transport  Fall 2018 We ran a working group on the theme of &amp;ldquo;statistical-to-computational gaps and statistical estimation with algebraic structure.</description>
